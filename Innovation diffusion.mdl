	~	This variable accounts for the process of adding funds from the public \
		sector to the system. Every time step, if the hubs utilization rate is \
		higher than the minimum utilization rate, then a certain amount of funds \
		is added. If the utilization rate is low, no funds are added (in this way, \
		if the infrastructure is unutilized, no extra infrastructure is built). \
		The exact amount depends on the gap of CO2 emissions. In this way, the \
		larger the gap, the higher the amount of funds that go into the system.
