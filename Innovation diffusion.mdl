increase in routing and consolidation efficiency=
	Potential for improving routing and consolidation efficiency*HUBS LOCATION VARIABLE
	*effect of using hub capacity on increase in routing and consolidation efficiency
	~	Dmnl/Month
	~	This is the rate at which the routing and consolidation efficiency \
		increases over time. For now, it is connected to the hubs location \
		variable (that is exogenous) and to the effect that using hub capacity has to the increase.
	|

effect of using hub capacity on increase in routing and consolidation efficiency=
	using hub capacity/TOTAL DEMAND*10
	~	1/Month
	~	This variable measures the effect that the fact that the capacity of the hub is being used has on the increase in routing and consolidation efficiency. It is divided by the total demand, which gives a 1/Month unit variable, and it is multiplied by 10 to account for a bigger change. 
	|

using hub capacity=
	IF THEN ELSE(gap of total utilized capacity<Total available hub capacity, gap of total utilized capacity\
		/ADJUSTMENT TIME FOR TOTAL UTILIZED CAPACITY, Total available hub capacity/ADJUSTMENT TIME FOR TOTAL UTILIZED CAPACITY\
		)
	~	Box/Month
	~	Outflow from the available hub capacity. It represents the act of companies of using \
		the hub capacity for their deliveries. It is calculated by using the gap of total utilized capacity, but it also accounts for the limited availability in hub capacity (therefore it needs an IF THEN ELSE structure).
		//
	|

gap of total utilized capacity=
	goal of total utilized capacity-Total utilized capacity
	~	Box
	~	Variable that calculates the gap between the goal of total utilized capacity and the total utilized capacity.
	|

	EMISSIONS OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY VEHICLE TYPES*TOTAL DEMAND*share of demand that goes through the hub\
		/Routing and consolidation efficiency
	 +
	EMISSIONS OF DIESEL TRUCKS*TOTAL DEMAND*(1-share of demand that goes through the hub\
		)/INITIAL ROUTING AND CONSOLIDATION EFFICIENCY
	~	CO2
	~	The operational emissions are calculated as follows: 1) emissions coming \
		from the environmentally friendly deliveries, assuming that the whole \
		demand that goes through the hub is carred out through those vehicles, \
		according to this emission value that is exogenous, and according to the \
		routing and consolidation efficiency, to account for the fact that hubs \
		also improve the efficiency; 2) emissions coming from diesel trucks, \
		assuming that the rest of the demand is carried out by those vehicles, \
		according to the emission value that is exogenous, and according to the \
		initial rounting and consolidation efficiency, assuming that these \
		deliveries have an unchanged value of efficiency.
	|

operation cost with hubs=
	MINIMUM OPERATION COST/Routing and consolidation efficiency
	~	$/(Month*company)
	~	The operation cost with hubs is the cost of deliveries when they go \
		through the hub system. It is calculated taking a minimum operation cost \
		and dividing it by the efficiency. In this way, the more demand goes \
		through the hub, the more efficient the system becomes, and therefore the \
		lower the cost of deliveries. It is calculated as an average cost per \
		month.
	|

goal of total utilized capacity=
	TOTAL DEMAND*share of companies that use the hub
	~	Box
	~	This variable represents the ideal goal of the utilized capacity. It is \
		measured by multiplying the total demand by the share of companies that \
		use the hub. This is assuming that all companies satisfy an equal share of \
		the demand.
	|

cost of using the hub system=
	IF THEN ELSE( share of companies that use the hub*TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPANIES<1, TOTAL OPERATION COST OF ONE HUB\
		*Hubs/ONE COMPANY, TOTAL OPERATION COST OF ONE HUB
	*Hubs/(share of companies that use the hub*TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPANIES))
	~	$/(Month*company)
	~	This cost represents the cost that each company has to pay, monthly, to be \
		part and use the hub system. There is a IF THEN ELSE function, because if \
		the number of companies on board is smaller than one (which practically \
		means that no company is onboard), the cost, instead of going up to more \
		than the total operation cost of one hub, stays at that value. Otherwise, \
		if there is at least a company on board, the cost is shared between the \
		number of companies that is onboard.

AVERAGE DELAY TIME IN DROPPING OUT=
	GET XLS CONSTANTS('Exogenous values.xlsm', 'company' , 'B5')
	~	Month [1,60,1]
	~	This is the average time, in months, that companies take to understand \
		that the monetary value of joining the hubs is actually negative, and \
		therefore decide to drop out of the system of hubs.
	|

Company adoption rate=
	IF THEN ELSE(company adoption fraction>0, Company potential adopters*company adoption fraction\
		*COMPANY CONTACT RATE*(Company adopters/TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPANIES),-Company adopters\
		/AVERAGE DELAY TIME IN DROPPING OUT)
	~	company/Month
	~	The company adoption rate is calculated using the innovation diffusion \
		theory. It represents the rate at which companies, from being potential \
		adopters, become adopters. There is an IF THEN ELSE structure, because the \
		company adoption fraction (as it is set up now) can be negative. It \
		becomes negative when the monetary value is negative. This means, that \
		when the monetary value is negative, companies will decide to drop out \
		(i.e. from adopters they go back again to being potential adopters). The \
		case when the monetary value is negative is here modelled as a delay: the \
		companies will take a certain amount of time (AVERAGE DELAY TIME IN \
		DROPPING OUT) to understand that the monetary value is negative and to act \
		on this knowledge, and drop out.
	|

adding funds=
	IF THEN ELSE(utilization rate of hubs<MINIMUM UTILIZATION RATE, 0, MAXIMUM FUNDS PER UNIT OF TIME\
		*gap of CO2 emissions)
	~	$/Month
	~	This variable accounts for the process of adding funds from the public \
		sector to the system. Every time step, if the hubs utilization rate is \
		higher than the minimum utilization rate, then a certain amount of funds \
		is added. If the utilization rate is low, no funds are added (in this way, \
		if the infrastructure is unutilized, no extra infrastructure is built). \
		The exact amount depends on the gap of CO2 emissions. In this way, the \
		larger the gap, the higher the amount of funds that go into the system. \
		This variable for now accounts only for public funding.
	|

adding hub capacity=

		for their deliveries.
	|

Total available hub capacity= INTEG (
	adding hub capacity-using hub capacity,
		0)
	~	Box [0,?]
	~	This stock represents the total available hub capacity. This increases \
		when a hub is added to the system, and decreases when the companies start \
		using the hub for their deliveries.
	|

total hub system capacity=
	Hubs*SINGLE HUB CAPACITY
	~	Box
	~	Total hub system capacity, accounting for all of the hubs in the system.
	|

utilization rate of hubs=
	IF THEN ELSE(total hub system capacity=0, 1, Total utilized capacity/total hub system capacity\
		)
	~	Dmnl
	~	The utilization rate represents how full the hub is (i.e., how much demand \
		goes through the hubs compared with the overall capacity of the hubs \
		system). It is therefore calculated as a division between the demand that \
		goes through the hub and the total hub system capacity. An IF THEN ELSE \
		structure is needed because otherwise at time 0, when the total hub system \
		capacity is 0, there is a division by 0 error.
	|

	GET XLS CONSTANTS('Exogenous values.xlsm','hubs','B3')
	~	Dmnl [0,1,0.01]
	~	Exogenous value that represents the minimum utilization rate of the hub \
		system. The utilization rate represents how full the hub is (i.e., how \
		much demand goes through the hubs compared with the overall capacity of \
		the hubs system). This minimum value is used to trigger the addition of \
		funds to the system. When this minimum value is reached, the public sector \
		can justify the addition of hubs.
	|

gap of CO2 emissions=
	IF THEN ELSE((emissions-GOAL OF CO2 EMISSIONS)/emissions<0, 0, (emissions-GOAL OF CO2 EMISSIONS\
		)/emissions)
	~	Dmnl
	~	This value represents the gap between the emissions of the system and the \
		goal of emissions. This is used to determine how much funds the public \
		sector adds to the system. An IF THEN ELSE structure is needed because it \
		could happen in the system that a lower value is reached, and this cannot \

	~	Month [0,60,1]
	~	Exogenous value that represents the number of months in which initially \

	|

operation cost without hubs=
	MINIMUM OPERATION COST/INITIAL ROUTING AND CONSOLIDATION EFFICIENCY
	~	$/(Month*company)
	~	The operation cost without hubs is the cost of deliveries when they do not \

	|

company adoption fraction=
	IF THEN ELSE(Time<INITIAL PUSH TIME, INITIAL COMPANY ADOPTION FRACTION, monetary value\
		/operation cost without hubs)
	~	Dmnl
	~	This variable is used in the innovation diffusion to understand how many \

		first part of the model (until time=INITIAL PUSH TIME) the adoption \
		fraction is fixed to INITIAL COMPANY ADOPTION FRACTION. After this initial \
